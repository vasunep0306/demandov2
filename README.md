#on livecoding1

This branch is a totally new branch based on my departure from Canisius College. I am working on/continually improving this project as a live coding series on Facebook.

Things to do:

1. Delete a classroom.
2. Restyle the teacher dashboard.
3. Annomaly detection system... (find malicious users)
