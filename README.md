#on livecoding1

This branch is a totally new branch based on my departure from Canisius College. I am working on/continually improving this project as a live coding series on Facebook.

Things to do (improvements/feature updates):

1. Delete a classroom. [functionality]
2. Restyle the teacher dashboard. [style]
3. Annomaly detection system... (find malicious users) [functionality]
4. Add font awesome (logos) [style]
5. Get rid of extra white space at the bottom of the login page. [style]
6. Center the content for where the student can answer the questions. [style]
7. Style error handler (style the custom crash web page we created that will ask the user to send the error info and then populate a mongo database.). [style]
8. Add constants for hardcoded types. [functionality]
9. Prevent teachers from accessing student routes and vice versa. [functionality]
10. Create an admin page. [functionality]
