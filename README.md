#on branch livecoding2

This branch is a totally new branch based on my departure from Canisius College. I am working on/continually improving this project as a live coding series on Facebook.

Things to do (improvements/feature updates):

1. Restyle the teacher dashboard. [style] #notstarted
2. Annomaly detection system... (find malicious users) [functionality] #notstarted
3. Get rid of extra white space at the bottom of the login page. [style] #inprogress
4. Prevent teachers from accessing student routes and vice versa. [functionality] #notstarted
5. Create an admin page. [functionality] #notstarted
6. If student is already enrolled, tell them they are in an alert box. [functionality] #notstarted
