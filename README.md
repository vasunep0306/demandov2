#on livecoding1

This branch is a totally new branch based on my departure from Canisius College. I am working on/continually improving this project as a live coding series on Facebook.

Things to do:

1. Delete a classroom.
2. Restyle the teacher dashboard.
3. Annomaly detection system... (find malicious users)
4. Add font awesome (logos)
5. Add the error message for invalid csv format.
6. Get rid of login border.
